# CrossHairGenerator
Creates a Crosshair on selected process.

Requires PyQt5 5.9.2 and latest version psutil as of 8/6/2019.

Requires pywin32

So far all it can do is grab the window list and find the location of the window.

Currently working on trying to figure out how to draw where I want to on screen current idea is just use PyQt5 getting some problems.

# CrossHairGenerator
Creates a Crosshair on selected process.

Require PyQt5 5.9.2 and latest version psutil as of 8/6/2019.

So far all it can do is grab the process list and put it in a combobox in PyQt

Currently working on trying to get window information from a process so I can know where to draw to the screen.
